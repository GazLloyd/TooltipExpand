TooltipExpand
=============

Minecraft mod to expand tooltips of held items to show uses. Requires Forge, CodeChickenCore and NEI

About
-----
This mod gives a box much like the NEI block hilight for blocks you are looking at (it uses the same API so should look very similar), but displays what you are holding instead. This is configurable to also show the uses remaining on any breakable item, and can account for the unbreaking enchantment.

You can individually say which item group you want the tooltips to appear for - unbreakable items (blocks, diamond, redstone torch, etc), breakable tools, breakable armour, tools with unbreaking, and armour with unbreaking. With the latter four you can set if you want to see the uses remaining or not, and the latter 2 you can choose between the minimum uses, the expected uses or both. You can also change the position.

All settings are in the NEI settings menu (open inventory -> *Options* in the bottom-left corner -> *Tooltip Expanded* button. Most titles and/or buttons have a tooltip to help you understand what's going on.


Installation
------------
1. Install Forge if you haven't - any 1.7.2 version will work. Follow instructions given by the installer. You can get forge [here](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php/topic,5.0.html). You may need to run Minecraft after installing forge to get it completely set up - you should do that before moving on.
2. Install CodeChickenCore and NEI if you haven't - any 1.7.2 version will work. Simply place the jars into your .minecraft/mods/ folder. (CodeChickenCore will also download the dependency CodeChickenLib the first time you run it after this step.) You can get both of these [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-164-smp-chickenbones-mods/) (yes, he has neglected to update the thread, just go to the downloads [here](http://www.chickenbones.craftsaddle.org/Files/New_Versions/links.php)).
3. Install TooltipExpand. Just put the jar into your .minecraft/mods/ folder like NEI. Done!

This is fully compatable with the [Magic Launcher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-launcher-magic-launcher-125-mods-options-profiles-news/) (and others I imagine), just like any forge mod.
